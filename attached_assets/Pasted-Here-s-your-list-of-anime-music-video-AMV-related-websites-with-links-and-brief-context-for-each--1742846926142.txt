Here’s your list of anime music video (AMV)-related websites with links and brief context for each. These platforms are key hubs for creating, sharing, and enjoying fan-made anime music videos, reflecting their purpose and reputation as of March 24, 2025.

1. **AnimeMusicVideos.org** - [https://www.animemusicvideos.org](https://www.animemusicvideos.org)  
   A central community hub founded by Kris McCormic (Phade) in 2000 for AMV creators to list, host, and discuss their works. It features forums, how-to guides, and a database of over 100,000 AMVs across thousands of anime titles. Funded by fan donations, it hosts annual Viewers' Choice Awards and remains a primary resource for AMV enthusiasts, despite some content removal requests from record labels like Wind-up Records in 2005.

2. **YouTube** - [https://www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com)  
   A global video-sharing platform where AMVs are widely uploaded by creators and fans. It’s a major distribution channel due to its accessibility, though copyright claims from music and anime rights holders often lead to takedowns, especially since its rise in popularity post-2005. Many AMV contests now allow uploads here after premieres elsewhere.

3. **AKROSS** - [https://www.akross.ru](https://www.akross.ru)  
   A Russian AMV community launched in 2002 as "AnimeClipmakers of Russia," hosting the prestigious annual AKROSS Con contest since 2003. Focused on high-quality, exclusive premieres, it’s creator-oriented and has historically been a leading platform in the Russian AMV scene, though its activity has declined compared to newer sites like AMVnews.

4. **AMVnews** - [https://amvnews.ru](https://amvnews.ru)  
   A Russian site started in 2006 by Turbo, aimed at viewers rather than just creators. It showcases top AMVs globally, hosts contests like Big Contest and Level Up, and offers a blog-style interface. It’s more active than AKROSS today, emphasizing accessibility and broad appeal, with events often featuring cash prizes and statuettes.

5. **AnimeClips** - (No official site found; likely refers to [https://animeclips.online](https://animeclips.online) or similar fan projects)  
   A less-defined entity, possibly a generic term or a smaller site like AnimeClips.online, which aggregates AMV clips for streaming or download. Without a clear flagship domain, it may represent scattered fan efforts on platforms like YouTube or Discord, focusing on short edits or highlights rather than full AMV hosting.

### Notes
- **Evolution**: AnimeMusicVideos.org and YouTube dominate globally, with the former being the archival backbone and the latter the mainstream distributor. AKROSS and AMVnews are Russian pillars, with AKROSS older but less active, and AMVnews thriving for its viewer focus. AnimeClips lacks a strong, singular identity, suggesting it’s either niche or fragmented.
- **Legality**: AMVs often face copyright scrutiny—AnimeMusicVideos.org has removed content under pressure (e.g., Evanescence tracks), and YouTube frequently flags videos, while AKROSS and AMVnews enforce premiere exclusivity to maintain control.
- **Community**: All cater to AMV fans, but AnimeMusicVideos.org and AKROSS lean toward creators, AMVnews toward viewers, YouTube to both, and AnimeClips (if a site) likely to casual browsers.
