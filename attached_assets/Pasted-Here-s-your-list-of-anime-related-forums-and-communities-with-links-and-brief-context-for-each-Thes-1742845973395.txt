### Additional Notes
- **Activity Levels**: Larger platforms like Reddit’s r/anime and 4chan’s /a/ are highly active, while older forums like AnimeNation and AnimeSuki have declined in use. Niche sites (e.g., ULMF, Fuwanovel) cater to specific interests with smaller, dedicated crowds.
- **Content Focus**: General anime discussion dominates on MyAnimeList, Anilist, and Animeforums, while MangaDex and MangaHelpers lean toward manga. ULMF and Anime-Sharing include adult content, and Fuwanovel targets visual novels.
- **Accessibility**: Most require no account for browsing (e.g., Reddit, 4chan), but posting or accessing downloads (e.g., Anime-Sharing, ULMF) often needs registration.
